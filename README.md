## RentUrTech API

> This is a Ruby on Rails API part of a full-stack project called "RentUrTech" (check the link to the front-end below). The main goal of this project is to provide users with an environment to reserve a specific product for a set amount of time. Thus, in this application users can create an account, can get an authorization token, and can retrieve all or one piece of equipment. They will be required to have an authorization token to manage their own reservations. For creating and destroying equipment, the user needs a proper role. Feel free to take this project and modify it for your own business use!

## API Full Documentation
